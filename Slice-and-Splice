Slice and Splice
You are given two arrays and an index.

Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.

Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.

Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.

function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
  let combinedArrays = arr2.slice()
  combinedArrays.splice(n, 0, ...arr1)
  return combinedArrays // [4, 1, 2, 3, 5]
}

frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1);

// note the use of spread operator (...) this allows you to input the contents of an array as the parameters
of a function where zero or more arguments are expected. If you don't do this you end up with and array inside an array
instead of them being joined.
